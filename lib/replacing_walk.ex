defmodule ReplacingWalk do
  @moduledoc """
  A hastily constructed replacing walk for use
  with `DeferredConfig`; not
  very performant, but for transforming data
  in options and config, can be convenient.

  require Logger
  
  @doc """
  Recursive replacing walk that uses `recognize` and
  `transform` functions to return a transformed version
  of arbitrary data. 

      iex> ReplacingWalk.walk [1, 2, 3], &(&1 == 2), &(&1 * &1)
      [1,4,3]

      iex> ReplacingWalk.walk( [1, [2, [3, 2]]],
      ...>                        &(&1 == 2), 
      ...>                        &(&1 * &1) 
      ...> )
      [1,[4, [3, 4]]]

  It works for Maps:
  
      iex> ReplacingWalk.walk %{2 => 1, 1 => 2}, &(&1 == 2), &(&1 * &1)
      %{4 => 1, 1 => 4}
  
  Structs in general are considered as leaf nodes; we support 
  structs that implement Enumerable, but **currently we expect
  their `Enumerable` implementation to work like a Map.
  If you feed this an Enumerable struct that doesn't iterate 
  like Map -- ie, doesn't iterate over `{k, v}` -- it will die. 
  (See an example in tests).
  
  We may change that behavior in the future -- either removing
  support for arbitrary Enumerables, or provision another protocol
  that can be implemented to make a data type replacing-walkable.

  Created quickly for
  `:deferred_config`, so it's probably got some holes;
  tests that break it are welcome.
